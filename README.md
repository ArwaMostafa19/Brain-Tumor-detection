# Brain-Tumor-detection
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors in MRI images. The model classifies scans as either tumor or normal, providing accurate and efficient detection to support the diagnostic process.

Overview
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors in MRI images. The model classifies scans as either tumor or normal, providing accurate and efficient detection to support the diagnostic process. Additionally, the project includes a web interface where users can upload MRI images.

Features

*Image Classification: The model is capable of classifying MRI images into two categories: tumor or normal.
*Web Interface: Users can upload an image through a simple web interface to get predictions.
*Efficient Detection: The CNN model offers reliable performance, helping to assist in medical diagnostics.

Technologies Used

* Python: The programming language for developing the project.
* Google Colab: The cloud-based platform for coding and running the machine learning model.
